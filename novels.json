So please, hold on until then.\"\n\nThese words from Vee, a girl he met as a child, became the boy's emotional support. Even if it was just a verbal promise.\n\nTheodore, the second son of the House of Count Allerton, is forced to handle all the paperwork that his older brother, Rodrick, should be doing. Unable to match his brother, a member of the Royal Capital's Knightly Order, in skill, Theodore quietly performs these tasks. However, their parents are oblivious to this reality, believing that the younger brother is merely assisting the heir of the family.\n\nAn offer of marriage into the family of the Margrave Harvey suddenly comes to Theodore. His father, wanting to establish a connection with the margrave's family, which is favored by the royal family, quickly decides to push Theodore into it. When Theodore arrives at the margrave's home, the one waiting for him is the very same girl from all those years ago.",

There’s been a mistake!!\"_\n\nCaught up in an otherworldly summoning gone horribly wrong—a true man-made disaster—an ordinary man is killed in the chaos and finds himself _strong-armed_ into reincarnation whether he likes it or not as the breathtakingly beautiful boy, Harold.\n\nDetermined to make the best of it, Harold adopts a personal motto: _“Live within my means.”_ His plan? A quiet, unremarkable life as a rural commoner.\n\nThe problem? The goddess who took a liking to him insists on saddling him with “gifts” like the **Favor of the Goddess Forte**, **Alchemist**, **Dimensional Storage**, and **Magic Eye (Appraisal)**. Oh, and his innate **Green Hand** skill? Turns out that’s a legendary ability in this world.\n\nBefore he knows it, Harold is shipped off to the Royal Academy in the capital—a place for nobles and other skilled youths—under compulsory enrollment. All he wants is a peaceful school life with his new friends… but special powers have a way of attracting _special problems_.\n\nFrom winning over fairies that haven’t shown themselves in decades, to accidentally solving a royal family’s age-old dilemma, Harold keeps standing out in all the wrong ways.\n\nCan he ever achieve the humble, peaceful life he longs for—or will the world keep pulling him center stage?",    "cover": "https://i.redd.it/7ks96yy94shf1.jpg",
