Don't be a bystander. Even as a clown, step onto the stage.(Author unknown)


Ding-dong, ding-dong...

The chime echoed through the school building on the first day of the new term, marking the start of the third period. The opening ceremony had wrapped up during the first and second periods, and class assignments had been announced.

For the record, I’m the homeroom teacher for a humanities course in the second year of Tsukishima High School. This is my third year as a high school teacher, but my first time as a homeroom teacher.

Part of me was anxious about whether I could handle the role. Still, I slid open the classroom door and stepped into the lively room. The students began to scatter and find their seats.

No, they weren’t about to start a deathmatch or get "locked on" after a "Stand, Bow!" command. Some had attended my classes last year, and I’d already introduced myself in the auditorium. Still, the nerves were there.

As the room fell silent, I stood at the teacher’s desk, took a deep breath, and began my introduction.

“Alright, some of you have had me in class before, and some of you are meeting me for the first time. Let me introduce myself. As mentioned in the auditorium earlier, I’ll be the homeroom teacher for 2-B starting today—”

Public speaking was never my strong suit. During my student teaching days and early on at this school, I’d stumble over my words from nerves. But after three years, you get used to it.

I turned to the whiteboard and wrote my name. Facing the students again, I continued, “—Shugo Kizasi. I’ll be counting on all of you for the next year.”

Clap, clap, clap...

The applause was brief but reassuring—until a male student raised his hand, stood up uninvited, and asked, “Sir, do you have a girlfriend?”

That sparked a chain reaction.

“What are your hobbies?”“Do you play any mobile games?”“What’s your favorite manga? Anime? Tell us!”

Yana once said marriage hunting was a battlefield, but school is a battlefield too—only here, you’re up against high schoolers. Some of the boys were taller than my average 170 cm, and some of the girls seemed more mature than high schoolers. In terms of mental maturity, some felt more grown-up than me.

As a mid-twenties guy, I wasn’t that different from them mentally. That’s what made dealing with them challenging.

Still, I knew how to handle it.

“I’m not an idol, so getting bombarded with personal questions is a bit much. You’ll get to know me gradually, but for now, let’s hear about you all. It’s self-introduction time.”

Groans of “Ehh...” and playful boos filled the room, but I pushed forward, and the students began introducing themselves.

With just over 30 students, some gave long introductions, others were brief. Once everyone was done, I moved on to the day’s schedule. As I wrapped up, the third-period chime rang.

Next was fourth period: distributing textbooks, rearranging seats, and finishing the day’s plans.

Since class representatives hadn’t been chosen, I assigned the greeting leader role to Aizawa, the first student on the attendance list, sitting in the front row on the far-right side. She’d been in my class last year and was on the track team. Her energetic demeanor made her perfect for the role.

“Yes!” Aizawa stood up with a lively response befitting an athlete.

She led with a crisp “Stand, Bow!” and the students replied in unison, “Thank you!” marking the end of the first session.

“Oh, one more thing. A quick announcement,” I added, stopping them as they began to stir. “From Aizawa to Ayase—the first ten students on the attendance list—head to the staff meeting room next to the faculty office just before the fourth-period bell. I’ll need your help carrying textbooks.”

Predictably, complaints like “Why us?” and “Why me?” arose, but I was ready.

“I get that it might feel unfair, but there’s plenty to do over the year. Everyone will pitch in at some point. For now, I’m counting on you ten, alright?”

“Here, Kizasi-sensei, have some tea.”

Back in the staff room, Kirarazaka-sensei, a slightly senior and stunningly beautiful teacher with fluffy hair, brought me a cup of tea.

“Thank you very much. Sorry for the trouble.”

“No trouble at all. The entrance ceremony is tomorrow, so I have some free time today.”

“Oh, that’s right...”

Kirarazaka-sensei was in charge of the first-year students starting tomorrow, so she had no classes today.

“So, how was your first time as a homeroom teacher?”

“I was definitely nervous. It reminded me of my teaching practicum or my first classes here.”

“That sounds about right for your first time as a homeroom teacher.”

Kirarazaka-sensei chuckled softly, but at that moment, Kaito-sensei returned, muttering, “Ah, my shoulders are so stiff,” while cracking his neck.

“Good work, Kaito-sensei. I’ll make some tea for you now.”

“Oh, thank you, Kirarazaka-sensei.”

As she prepared tea, Kirarazaka-sensei continued, “We were just talking about Kizasi-sensei’s first time as a homeroom teacher. How about you, Kaito-sensei? How are your new students?”

“Eh... Well, haha, as expected, third-years are pretty tense. Probably because I mentioned the word ‘exams.’”

“Ha-ha-ha!” Kaito-sensei laughed. “Well, I am a PE teacher, after all. Most people assume I’m not involved with exams or career paths—and to be fair, that’s mostly true...”

“True, being a homeroom teacher for third-years is more demanding. There’s so much to think about. Here you go.” Kirarazaka-sensei handed him the tea and added, “But you also get to share in their joys and send them off on new journeys. It’s deeply moving. If you need help, feel free to ask me—your senior with experience as a third-year homeroom teacher.”

“Yes, of course!” Kaito-sensei replied, his face turning bright red.

Kirarazaka-sensei had just sent off her first batch of third-years last year. As the three of us—homeroom teachers for the humanities course—chatted about the differences between humanities and science courses, the bell rang, signaling the start of the fourth period.

“Oh, is it that time already?” Kaito-sensei stood up, stretching.

“The students are already here,” he said, gesturing toward the staff room entrance, where a few students were milling about.

“Is this for the textbook distribution? I’ll help too,” Kirarazaka-sensei offered.

“Really? Thank you so much!” Kaito-sensei responded, delighted.

After promising to help Kirarazaka-sensei with her class’s textbook distribution tomorrow, Kaito-sensei and I joined her in heading to the staff meeting room, where the textbooks were stored.

The hallway was bustling with students. Some teachers had already started distributing textbooks. As we set up our station, students from Kaito-sensei’s class approached first.

As we handed out textbooks, my students arrived. Two boys from the baseball team were the first to speak.

“Kizasi, hurry up with the textbooks!”

“Don’t call your homeroom teacher by name like that,” I grumbled, handing one his textbooks.

Kirarazaka-sensei handed the other his books with a gentle smile. “Here you go. Be careful not to drop them.”

Her hair swayed lightly, and a sweet scent brushed past my nose.

“Th-thank you so much!” The boys, grinning ear to ear, were clearly smitten.

My other students whispered, “Kirarazaka-sensei is so pretty!” “I heard she’s fluent in English because she’s an English teacher.” “Man, I wish she were our homeroom teacher.” “Me too!”

Honestly, I couldn’t disagree. If I were a student, I’d probably prefer Kirarazaka-sensei too. Getting a textbook from her would definitely be more exciting.

Still, as their actual homeroom teacher, I couldn’t just stand by.

“Alright, you lot, stop chatting and take your textbooks. And Kaito-sensei—Kaito-sensei!”

“Huh?! Oh, yes!” Kaito-sensei snapped back to attention, clearly lost in thought.

“What are you spacing out for?”

“Huh? Ah... sorry, sorry!”

It was obvious Kaito-sensei was entranced by Kirarazaka-sensei.

“Here you go, Kaito-sensei.”

“Thank you so much, Kirarazaka-sensei!” he stammered, completely smitten.

We finished distributing textbooks by the eighth student, but I had called ten to help, so I had the remaining two girls carry handouts back to the classroom.

As we walked, one of the girls, Reina Uzaki, spoke up with a sly grin. She had long, dyed blonde hair and a stylishly casual uniform—an unmistakable gyaru.

“Sensei, can I ask you something?”

I was wary. Uzaki was the type to tease anyone, regardless of status, and I wasn’t great at handling her type.

“What is it...” I asked cautiously.

She leaned in close, her lips nearly brushing my ear, and said loudly, “Hey, earlier, wasn’t Kaito-sensei totally head over heels for Kirarazaka-sensei? Do you think he might actually like her?”

“Wha—”

She hit the nail on the head. Luckily, Kaito-sensei wasn’t nearby to overhear.

“Don’t you agree, Sakucchi? You thought so too, right?” Uzaki said, turning to the other girl, Sakura Ayase. Ayase had neat black pigtails and glasses, the picture of a reserved bookworm—Uzaki’s polar opposite.

“Uh, well... I guess I kind of thought so...” Ayase replied hesitantly.

“See? Even Sakucchi thought so!” Uzaki chimed in triumphantly.

Despite their contrasting personalities, they seemed close. Uzaki turned her mischievous attention back to me.

“So, what do you think, Kizasi-sensei? Do you know anything?”

“Know anything about what?”

“About Kaito-sensei and what he thinks of Kirarazaka-sensei, of course! Oh, wait... don’t tell me you’re interested in Kirarazaka-sensei too? I mean, she’s insanely beautiful. Even some of the boys in class are totally head-over-heels for her.”

“No, that’s—”

“Haha, Sensei, you’re totally blushing! Are you shy when it comes to things like that? Are you a virgin or something? Kaito-sensei kind of gives off the same vibe.”

“Hey, stop with the virgin jokes. Those are the kinds of words high school girls shouldn’t throw around. And I’m sure Ayase-san’s uncomfortable too.”

Ayase gave a small, awkward smile.

“Well, compared to Kaito-sensei, I think it’d be easier for you, Kizasi-sensei, to get a girlfriend. You’re actually pretty cute when you look closely. Maybe you should try one of those dating apps. You could probably get a girlfriend right away!”

“Eh...”

“Haha, Sensei, you’re so flustered! That’s adorable~♡”

“You...”

Still, I couldn’t help but think—(Kaito-sensei... everything is being exposed. And I’m just as guilty...)

I laughed bitterly inside. I never expected “dating app” to come up in this conversation.

Even though they’re high school students, these gyaru are terrifying.

I truly thought that from the bottom of my heart.
