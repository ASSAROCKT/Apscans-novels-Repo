### **1. General Translation Style Guide**

*   **Tone:** The primary narrative voice is Harold's, which is often wry, cynical, and pragmatic, colored by his past life as a weary office worker. This should contrast with the more fantastical or dramatic elements of the world. His internal monologues, often critical or exasperated, should be rendered in italics. The overall tone should be smooth and natural-sounding English.
*   **Honorifics:** Japanese honorifics will be retained as they are crucial for conveying social hierarchy, relationships, and respect (or lack thereof).
    *   `-sama`: Used for deities (Forte-sama), royalty (Ludovig-denka, though `denka` is often translated, the text implies a level of respect that `-sama` could also capture if needed), and figures of extremely high status.
    *   `-kun`: Used for boys of similar or younger age, like `Harold-kun` or `Aaron-kun`. It denotes familiarity and a casual, friendly relationship.
    *   `-san`: A general-purpose honorific for peers or superiors. To be used if it appears in the text (e.g., `Asher-san`).
*   **Sentence Structure:** Sentences may be rearranged, combined, or split from the original Japanese to create a better narrative flow in English. The priority is readability and maintaining the intended meaning and tone, not a literal word-for-word translation.
*   **Cultural Nuances:** Concepts like `senpai/kouhai` dynamics, while not explicit, inform relationships (e.g., Harold's attitude towards older students or authority figures). This should be conveyed through tone and dialogue rather than direct translation.
